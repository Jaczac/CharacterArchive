Fist backstory

William Pugnacious Charnock Aberrfraw Atherton, or Fist for short, is a 12 year old magical prodigy. 

Born a sickly child with a rare blood disease, he spent the first 8 years of his life with books and doctors, unable to leave the house. He studied especially the occult and of war. 

His family was a great house in <fantasy britain>, with many nefarious magical investments. After a deal went sour, a cabal of warlocks put a virulent bloodline curse on his family. He and all his siblings took ill, and all but one of his brothers died from it. William found that the curse had burnt the blood from his veins and left something stranger and more powerful. 

After getting revenge on the cabal and saving his remaining sibling, he went to a number of magic schools in rapid succession. Each time he was kicked out for his destructive temper and advanced skill.

He ended up at <fantasy britain>'s finest war school,<fantasy eton>, where he butted heads with classmates 5-6 years older than him. After getting his teeth kicked in by an older student who tricked him into a null magic field,(and when his classmates misunderstood one of his middle names) he earned the nickname Fist. After two years and several exploded or burnt down buildings, he left <fantasy eton> to get some hands on experience and fuck some shit up.
