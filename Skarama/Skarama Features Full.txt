Air Lacer:
	Elemental Strike
		At 1st level, your practice with lacing allows you to blast an opponent with an elemental strike. You can use your elemental strike when you make an attack. Your elemental strike has the following properties:
		You roll a d6 for the damage of your elemental strike. This die changes as you gain lacer levels, as shown in the Elemental Strike column of the Lacer table. Your elemental strike deals bludgeoning damage.
		Your elemental strike is a ranged weapon with a normal range of 20 feet, or a long range of 60 feet. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the strike's long range.
		Despite being a ranged weapon, you do not have disadvantage on attack rolls with your elemental strike when a hostile creature is within 5 feet of you, nor when attacking a creature that is prone within 20 feet of you.
		You can use Strength instead of Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls of your elemental strike.
		When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can choose to avoid killing them with your elemental strike, leaving them unconscious.

	Deflection
		You can spend 1 ki point as a reaction to deflect or dissipate an elemental strike, form attack, or spell attack that would deal damage to you. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your ki ability modifier + your lacer level.
	Power Blow
		When you hit an enemy with an elemental strike, you can spend 1 ki point to force the enemy to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the enemy is pushed 10 feet away from you.
	Surprising Angle:
		When you make an attack against a creature with an elemental strike, you can spend 1 ki point to hit the target from any angle, not simply in a straight line. This allows you to ignore the effects of any amount of cover except for total cover.
	Forms: 11, 3
	Prana Burst
		Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with an elemental strike, you can expend 1 ki point to deal an additional 1d8 damage to the target.

	Elemental Arts - 8 Palms

		You can designate one 5-foot cube as an action. The area you designate is silenced until the beginning of your next turn. No sound can be created within or pass through the area. Any creature or object entirely inside the area is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.

	Push it
		Starting at 7th level, you are able to push yourself past your normal limits. As a bonus action, you can regain 2 ki points, up to your maximum number of ki points. When you use this feature, you must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you suffer one level of exhaustion.

Air Sanctuary 
	You make friends quickly and easily, even with those who others might shy away from. You are not as easily intimidated as others by creatures with whom you can communicate, and those creatures are more likely to be friendly toward you.

Air Glider
	Air Glider. The air glider is a specialized staff created by the air monks. It appears to be a normal quarterstaff, although it is not used for combat (and is in fact quite fragile). Despite this fact, an airlacer can hold an air glider in their hands and still perform all airlacing normally, including elemental attacks and forms. The true purpose of the air glider is to extend the large main wings (as well as a set of auxiliary wings at the base) and use the glider to fly. The wings can be extended with a bonus action. Anyone can use the glider to glide. Your rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round. You can move horizontally up to 60 feet each round while you glide. An airlacer (anyone who has access to Basic Airlacing) can instead use the glider to truly fly. As a bonus action while flying, you can choose to reduce your fall rate to 0. If you take an action, you can instead climb up to 30 feet. You can move horizontally up to 60 feet each round while you glide. An airlacer who has ki points can spend 1 ki point as an action to double their speed while gliding. For 10 minutes (as long as you concentrate), you can gain up to 60 feet vertically each round, and you can move up to 120 feet horizontally.
